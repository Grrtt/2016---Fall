				<p>1. What is a markup language?</p>
				A markup language is a language that describes the content and structure of a document by identifying, or tagging, different elements in the document.
				
				<p>2. What is XHTML? How does XHTML differ from HTML?</p>
				XHTML stands for "Extensible Hypertext Markup Language." XHTML, unlike HTML, is very strict in its syntax.
				
				<p>3. What is the W3C? What is the WHATWG?</p>
				W3C is the World Wide Web Consortium, who have set up standards for Web browser manufacturers, and tried to push XHTML.
				WHATWG was an off-shoot of W3C that pushed forward development on HTML5, set to rival XHTML 2.0. Untimately, HTML5 won out as XHTML 2.0 was stalled indefinitely in 2009.
				
				<p>4. What is a doctype? What are two uses of the doctype?</p>
				A Doctype is a Document Type Declaration. Depending on the doctype used, the web page will render differently. Also, the document will be (in)validated depending on the doctype used and the document's following syntax.
				
				<p>5. What is incorrect about the syntax of the following code?</p>
				<pre><p>Welcome to the <em>J-Prop Shop</p></em></pre>
				The cose is written improperly, with the emphasis element straddling the closing paragraph tag. While it displays properly, its formatted in a less legible way than standard.
				
				<p>6. What is white space? How does HTML treat consecutive occurrences of white space?</p>
				White space is "empty" space in a document. HTML treats white space as inconsequential, and it will not be rendered.
				
				<p>7. What structural element would you use to mark a sidebar?</p>
				The aside tag.
				
				<p>8. What structural element would you use to mark the page footer?</p>
				The footer tag.
